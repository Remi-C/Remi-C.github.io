title: My woodworking design philosophy
---

Of course I'm not a designer, however after several woodworking projects,
I started to think to the common points in my approaches.

## Designing for Human 
The object is always designed starting from a human need (usually friend or familly).
The goal is to answer perfectly to the need I think they have.
The object is always deeply connected with the person (tailored).

The design is functionnal (starting from the function it fullfills for the human).

The object is not primarly designed for machine (to be easily manufacturable).

## Durability
The object should be durable, meaning both that its functionnality should last a long time,
and that the owner (and Mankind) should last a long time: the object should be build in a sustainable way.
Durability comes from material choices, mecanical properties,  a good design, and attention to details.

## Simplicity
Over-engeneerign is always tempting, but simplicity has many advantages.
First what is simple is less fragile.
Second simplicity has a powerfull aesthetic,
human seem to be fascinated by symmetry and simple forms.

## Inspiration from nature
Nature produce the ultimate design for durability, sustainability and simplicity!
It's only natural to draw inspiration from it.
