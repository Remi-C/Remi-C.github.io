# bench top gluing #
Before any gluing, it is important to test, and to remember that a good gluing will save you many hours afterwards.

1. assemble parts one by one, adjusting if necessary
2. Take great care to put the wood pieces in the right orientation!
3. the better the gluing preparation, the less work they will be to straighten the bench top.
