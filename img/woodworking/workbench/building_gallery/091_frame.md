# Frame #
Once you have the legs,
lay the frame on the ground.

Control length, angle, height of each parts, then draw the limits of the half wood join.
Keep in mind that wood will be easy to remove if the join is to tight, but hard to had if the join is to loose.

Before drawing, all parts of the future joins should be flat and squared.
