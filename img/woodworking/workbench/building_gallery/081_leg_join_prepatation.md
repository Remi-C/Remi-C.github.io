# leg joins preparation #
For all joins, 
both pieces of wood to be joined should be flat, with square sides.

To achieve this, first flatten the largest dimension with sand paper, 
then use square to square other dimensions.

Usually, you don't need to flatten both large faces.

When everything is flat and squared, trace and cut the leg to size.

Precise cutting is actually difficult and needs practice beforehand.
