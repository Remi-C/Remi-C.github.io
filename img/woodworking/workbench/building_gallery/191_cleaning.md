# Cleaning #
Usually not part of tutorial, but important!
Sweep with broom frequently (even just roughly), every hour or so.

Actually, still remaining work!

- If you used metal rods, they have to be cut so they don't stick.
- bench top sides need to be cut straights.

Upgrades : 

- add a leg press.
- add an end wise end bench dogs.
- add holdfasts.
- use epoxy to increase workbench hardness.
