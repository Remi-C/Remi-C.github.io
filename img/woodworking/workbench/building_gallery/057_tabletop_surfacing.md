# table top surfacing #
After at least 24h (more is better), you can start surfacing the bench top.

The traditional method would  be to use a plane, which is expensive and takes practice.
Instead, I propose a method based on the japanese saw.

The idea is to create pencil marks on the bench top,
then use slicing motions with the saw at an angle of 30Â°,
using the middle of the saw.

Because a saw is perfectly straight, you only remove top spot.
With enough repetition, you can straighten the whole bench.
