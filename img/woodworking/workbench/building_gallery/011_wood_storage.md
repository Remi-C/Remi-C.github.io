# Wood storage #
Construction wood is often not very dry, at least not to cabinet making standards.
Because the completion of the workbench may take several weeks,
it is important to store the wood as flat as possible.

A proper wood management is also important: 

1. mark defects on wood (knots, holes, etc.) 
2. assign wood for bench / frame, depending on quality 
3. order the wood for the bench top (alternating grain direction), number wood
