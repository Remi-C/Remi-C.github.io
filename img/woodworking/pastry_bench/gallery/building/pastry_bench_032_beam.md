The transverse pieces are joined ot the frame with a through tenon - mortize.
The through tenons are then blocked with wedges.
I made a mistake here. Given the use of softwood, the tenon should be 3 times larger, to the inside wedge is 3 times larger as well, and is able to give the necessary rigidity.
