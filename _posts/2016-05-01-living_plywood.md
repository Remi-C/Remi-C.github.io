This project is an open idea about using the natural ability of some wood species to fuse together (anastomosis).

Beside, wicker have the ability to grow very fast and very often from not much.

So the idea would be to peel green wicker and shape them in square section, then assemble the section to form random forms.
Rooting hormone may potentially be useful to help healing.  
The resulting set of wicker would be left to heal for hopefully few days/week.

This project sucess would solve a millenia old problem in  woodworking : having to assemble small pieces to make a big one.

In wookworking half the wood is often lost simply in the making process (shaping and so).
Besides, plywood is full of glue and is hard to use for complex 3D forms.
