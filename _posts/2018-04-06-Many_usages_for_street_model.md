About city model usage
![street model usage](/img/re/sota/3d_model_usage.png)

# TRANSPORT, MOBILITY, AUTONOMOUS CARS # 
traffic simulation:
lanes, speed, trajectory, curves.
pedestrian trajectory. 
multi-modality :bikes?
role in the global road network?
 
What's around, implicit sidewalk limit. Shared space with pedestrian. GPS shortage? varying fooliage with season, water in pavment may glitch sensor. Role in road network. Accurate geocoding to know where to pickup and drop off.

# Security safety # 
SECURITY
line of sight for pedestrian, bollard : hard to see, signs,
 wide enough for firetruck, covered by cameras? sensible building in the surrounding streets?
 Trip hazard, access for wheelchair/ stroller?

# Public work#
PUBLIC WORK
What's in underground. Where are exactly gas/water/electricity/IT cables.
age / shape of pavement, status of urban furniture.
How long the street can be blocked for public work?

# ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT #
temperature, humidity, noise, pollution, sunlight
local and at city scale.
Vegetation type/species, are trees ini good shape?
Water flow, innundation?
