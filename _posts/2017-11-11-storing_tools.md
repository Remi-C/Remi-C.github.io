I spent a lot of preparing tools for my cabinet maker exam.

Indeed, most of my tools where found in flea markets, then refurbished and sharpened. 

## Design equipment ##
The notable exception is my design equipment, which is all new, essentially because of my beginner status.

I found a case in the flea market, it was a case used to store professionnal kitchen knifes, thus it is sturdy (and ugly enough)

The main requirement for the exam is technical drawing. I calibrated felt-tip pen.
I commonly use 0.8 (title), 0.5 (subtitle, important stuff), 0.3 (base) and 0.1 (measure, textures, details) mm tips.

For the creative part of the design, alcohol-based pens are very useful, especially the scale of grey ones.
I latter added some with brown tone shading specifically for wood representation,
and the primary color one for general schematics. Only problem is that the ink will go thorugh most of the papers.

Per the exam rules, a calculator is required, as well as a set of rules and squares. 
I added some basic forms templates (circles, curves), which is useful when designing at the 1:1 scale.
