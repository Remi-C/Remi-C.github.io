I spent a lot of preparing tools for my cabinet maker exam.

Indeed, most of my tools where found in flea markets, then refurbished and sharpened. 




## Woodworking tools ##
As a general principle, I tend to loose stuf, so I took that into account when deciding what tools to take and how to store it.

I don't have toolboxes where tools are free to move (dulling their sharpening), and where it's easy to loose something. 
Instead, each tool has its place and is protected (usually foam).

Because I used several workshop, my tools are split into thematic storage so they can be transportable and I can adapt what toolbox to take.

### Marking equipment / essential ###

The first cabinet maker tools beside the workbench are the marking / drawing tools in my opinion.
Therefore I came with the idea to use a rugged case full of foam.
The foam is cut in layers so each tool has a very specific place ,
and I can see immediately if I forgot something.

The tools are selected by how often I use them and their genericity.

The foam sits on top of a wood plank. When removing it, I access flat stuff that I don't use too often. 
Abrasive papers from 100 to 2000 and a leather strop with raw leather and green coumpound for sharpening. 
Scrappers are amazing in my opinion. Both low tech and extremely efficient.
Saddly they are very difficult to sharpen properly with a traditionnal steel burnisher.
Thanksfully, a french company build carbide burnisher, the carbide quickly pushing the steel from the scrapper.

So the first role of the tools in this case is marking and measuring.

#### measuring ####
I use steel rules with engraved digits with various size and flexibility, and a measuring tap.
Same with the squares. The japanese square is extremely handy with its 45Â° angle, same as saddle squares (both straight and for dovetail), and false square (which is not super handy, as it can't be locked in a position).
Last a compass (with blocking and precise adjustement), and a precise caliper. 

In my opinion measuring tools should be made of metal, not plastic or wood. 
I trued myself the rules and squares. Indeed, even decent rulers have machining marks.

#### marking ####

Color chalks are useful to mark parts and to avoid mistakes by outlining stuff. 

To mark lines, pencils are very common but not precise enough. Drawing knifes sharpened to have only one bevel ( in fact the folding knife has 2 blades, each having the bevel one a different side) are necessary to reach the 0.1 mm accuracy range. 
Alternatively, a pen with a carbide tip is strong enough to mark even hardened steel. 
The marking gauge is essential ,both in measure and markings. It has to be sharpened once in a while. This model has a tendancy to roll and untrue itself. 

#### Real handy tools ####
Camelia oil has been used on japanase tools for a long time, I reallt like it after sharpening/contact with water.
For instance when using my 'emergency' 1k diamond stone.

Paraffin wax is also useful as a protection and to improve sliding of tools.  
Scrappers are true MVP of any toolbox. Inexpensive, flexible, and producing a world class finish in my opinion. Hard to sharpen, so their edges is protected in leather pouches.

Last few wood chisels are always useful.

## Design equipment ##
The notable exception is my design equipment, which is all new, essentially because of my beginner status.

I found a case in the flea market, it was a case used to store professionnal kitchen knifes, thus it is sturdy (and ugly enough)

The main requirement for the exam is technical drawing. I calibrated felt-tip pen.
I commonly use 0.8 (title), 0.5 (subtitle, important stuff), 0.3 (base) and 0.1 (measure, textures, details) mm tips.

For the creative part of the design, alcohol-based pens are very useful, especially the scale of grey ones.
I latter added some with brown tone shading specifically for wood representation,
and the primary color one for general schematics. Only problem is that the ink will go thorugh most of papers types.

Per the exam rules, a calculator is required, as well as a set of rules and squares. 
I added some basic forms templates (circles, curves), which is useful when designing at the 1:1 scale.
