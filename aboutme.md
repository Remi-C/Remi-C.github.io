I'm a frnech engineer witha  Ph.D in computer science.
I'm interested in lot of fields of computer science, mostly about computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning and database/big data.

My Ph.D was about inverse procedural street modelling, and was divided in roughly three parts : one part to generate/edit a street model in database (streetgen, using postgres/postgis), one part to deal with massive point cloud in database (point cloud server), and one otpimisation part to fit a street model to observations extracted from mobile mapping street images/point cloud.

I like [to travel](http://www.laruevibre.org/) and gourmet food/drinks.
I also like manual craft, such as leather craft and [wood working](http://remi-c.github.io/ultra_molkky/).
