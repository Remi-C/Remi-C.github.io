My name is Rémi Cura Gauriau, I'm a french engineer with a Ph.d. in computer science.
I'm very curious, and I like [traveling](http://www.laruevibre.org/) and hand craft, such as [wood craft](https://github.com/Remi-C/ultra_molkky) and leather craft.

I'm married with [Romane Gauriau](https://www.linkedin.com/in/romanegauriau), we live in Paris.
