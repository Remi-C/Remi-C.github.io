subtitle: About my activities as a consultant and trainer
---
In 2017 I started a side activity (freelancer) as a consultant and trainer for the subjects I specialised during my [PhD]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-09-12-Inverse_procedural_street_modelling %}) thesis.
(see my [CV/Resume](../CV) and [skills](../skills) for more details)

In fact the "consulting" part is not really new, as I have been helping people on open source PostGis mailing list for several years.
Morevover, consulting is quite similar in spirit to classical inter-colleague collaboration in a research lab.

As for the "training" part,
I recently gave a 3 day training specialized on point cloud.
This very practical session was about _Open source software for visualisation and processing of point clouds_.
The main open source software used are CloudCompare, Meshlab, the PCL, and PDAL.


The detailed programm of the training is [here in french](http://www.oslandia.com/pages/formation-pointcloud.html) )
