I'm an engineer with a  Ph.D. in computer science, passionate about data, and interested in many topcis!
I worked incomputer vision, computer graphics, machine learning and database/big data.

I really like to work with less-technical people in the computational social science field.

I'm currently a postdoctoral associate at M.I.T in the political science department. 

My [Ph.D](https://github.com/Remi-C/inverse_procedural_street_modelling) 
was about inverse procedural street modeling, and was divided in roughly three parts 
: one part to generate/edit a street model in database 
([streetgen](http://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/II-3-W5/409/2015/isprsannals-II-3-W5-409-2015.pdf) 
([videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn4KJ6gBgPuVQV3suF4QbjQ)), 
using postgres/postgis), 
one part to deal with massive point cloud in database ([point cloud server](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092427161630123X), 
[implicit Level Of Detail](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06920)), 
and one optimization part to fit a street model to observations extracted from mobile mapping street images/point cloud.

I also freelanced [consulting and training](./consulting_and_training) on subjects related to my PhD.


I really like to have hobbies, such as [traveling](http://www.laruevibre.org/) and gourmet food/drinks.
I also like manual craft, such as leather craft, [wood working](http://remi-c.github.io/ultra_molkky/), design and gear making.
