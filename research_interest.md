title: Research interest
subtitle: A short description of my research interests
---

I'm quite curious and have wide spanning intellectual interests. As such it is no surprise that 
I touched lots of research subjects during my education, my hobbies and during my working life.

I'd say that the common points are that I like *tangible/graphical* subjects,
and that I put great importancy on *data*.


## Reconstruction
My PhD is about street reconstruction, so of course I'm interested in reconstruction.

I'm interested in all kind of reconstruction
 - very data-driven ( surface reconstruction from point cloud for instance)
 - model driven (fitting planes, gaussian, etc.)
 - based on procedural/grammar, although there are few articles
 - based on catalog matching (fitting known 3D models from a catalog)

The 3D is to be reconstructed, but sometime it is much more (4D, semantic, network..), which is exciting.

## Modelling
I chose to tackle my PhD problem with inverse procedural modelling, which implied reading a lot of modelling papers.

I'm really fascinated by modelling, as I see it as a way to abstract (summarize) things.
There is beauty in finding the essence of something.

In my opinion finding a good model is as usefull for a problem as it is usefull for us human to learn something about the things being modelled. 

Of course there are tradeoff between the chosen model expressivity and its complexity.
At one end the way points are modelled in the Point Cloud Server for instance is very simple, but does not provide much information. At the other end grammar or procedural modelling can generate powerfull models at the price of complexity.

## Remote sensing
I worked 3 years in the french mapping agency using mobile mapping data. 
I really like remote sensing, as this research field mixes massive amount of data and a no-bullshit approach.
Wathever the proposed method, it must really work, not only to write a paper about it.

Furthermore, remote sensing research tend to be really close to the hardware used (Lidar, camera, GPS, etc.),
which make the field deeply rooted in engeenering and physics.
The field is also subject to a never ending quest for precision to accurately describe the reality,
which I found challenging.

## Database
Both my work on street modelling, on point clouds and on historical geocoding use massively a relational database management system.
I find this field extremely interesting, as the whole system (postgres +postgis + SQL) has been developped for decades to become perfectly adapted to data manipulation.
I found the open source community extremely helpfull and pleasant to work with (both by mail and at sprint).
Besides, PostgreSQL must be the best software I know.

Database presents lots of challenge, of course regarding architecture (cf modelling)
, query optimisation
but also regarding perfomance, indexing, etc.
