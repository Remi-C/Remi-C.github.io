I'm a french engineer (Science and Technology of Telecommunication) with a Ph.D in computer science applied to Geographical Information.
I'm interested in [lots of fields](./research_interest) of computer science, mostly about computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning and database/big data, remote sensing and digital humanities.


My [research work](./publi) involves a PhD and [a postdoc]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-01-01-historical_geocoding %}) so far.


My [Ph.D]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-09-12-Inverse_procedural_street_modelling %}) was about inverse procedural street modelling, and was divided in roughly three parts:
 - one part to generate/edit a street model in database called [StreetGen]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-01-01-streetgen %}),  [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn4KJ6gBgPuVQV3suF4QbjQ) using postgres/postgis.
