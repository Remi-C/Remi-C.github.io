I'm a french engineer (Science and Technology of Telecommunication) with a Ph.D in computer science applied to Geographical Information.
I'm interested in [lots of fields](./research_interest) of computer science, mostly about computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning and database/big data, remote sensing and digital humanities.


My [research work](./publi) involves a PhD and [a postdoc]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-01-01-historical_geocoding %}) so far.


My [Ph.D]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-09-12-Inverse_procedural_street_modelling %}) was about inverse procedural street modelling, and was divided in roughly three parts:
 - one part to generate/edit a street model in database called [StreetGen]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-01-01-streetgen %}),  [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn4KJ6gBgPuVQV3suF4QbjQ) using postgres/postgis.    
 -  one part to deal with massive point cloud in database [Point Cloud Server]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-02-01-point_cloud_server.md %}), [Implicit LOD]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-02-02-implicit_lod %}) .
 - and one optimisation part to fit a street model to observations extracted from mobile mapping street images/point cloud (chap. 5 in thesis).
 
I like [to travel](http://www.laruevibre.org/?lang=en) and gourmet food/drinks.
I also like manual craft, such as leather craft and wood working, [with several projects](./woodworking_projects).
